glucose-syrup-4.1, Windows port
===============================

Only "Simp" is ported, not "Parallel".

Download the prebuilt `glucose.exe` binary from the `\prebuilt_binaries` directory.

Or build `glucose.sln` yourself from the `\msvc-2017` directory.

Updated October 6, 2019:
- certificates should now work
- piping input from stdin should now work
